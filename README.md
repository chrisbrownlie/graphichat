An R Shiny app for visualising Whatsapp chat data

# Background
This project was started off the back of [an article I published on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/3-5-years-of-a-relationship-in-whatsapp-messages-4f4c95073c9d?source=friends_link&sk=d3e19170b2215e6ee5b3d13a80235177), where I analysed 3.5 years of data from my Whatsapp chat with my girlfriend. The article was extremely well received and I had many people contact me, asking how they could do the same.
The analysis in the original article was produced using R, so I decided to develop an app using Shiny so that other people could investigate their own chat data.

# Repo contents
- ui.R, server.R and global.R files for the specification of the app
